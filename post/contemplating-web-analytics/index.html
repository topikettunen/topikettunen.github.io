      <p>I started to rekindle my, unfortunately, lost writing habit a couple of
weeks ago. I set up Google Analytics for this page mainly due to its
ease of use to see simple analytics. I was only interested in visitor
count and possibly from what source my readers are coming. Google
Analytics is a massive tool with massive amounts of data going into
it. I tried to restrict this collection as much as possible so it suits
my personal blog&rsquo;s needs.</p>
<p>Then my page rose to the front page of Hacker News, and it started to
get a lot of traction. Suddenly there were thousands of readers coming
every day to my pesky little page with just a few posts as I was
following the visitor counts rising in my Google Analytics view. That
got me thinking about the ethics of this kind of tracking. Which then
ended up me deleting my account and data from it.</p>
<h2 id="discomfort-of-tracking">Discomfort of Tracking</h2>
<p>Before I deleted my data and account from Google Analytics, I first
looked for different alternatives. I stumbled upon many other
privacy-oriented and GDPR-compliant analytics platforms, which at first
seemed promising. Also, having good options for ever prevalent Google
Analytics is a great thing. But despite these features, they don&rsquo;t
remove the uneasiness what mining your users' data causes. We are
talking about spying here. Thankfully there are now some restrictions
regarding personally identifiable information (PII), at least in the
GDPR, limiting the shadiness of this quite a lot. But that brings new
issues in handling this kind of information since you need to be sure
that your software doesn&rsquo;t leak this information. Thankfully also
opting-out completely from collecting PII in your software is an
option.</p>
<p>I understand why people might want to add at least simplistic tracking
to their sites since it can provide useful information about your
content, and companies can see how users use their site, and the list
goes on. Especially when you combine Google Analytics, or similar
analytics tool, to ads, companies can reap significant benefits from
this kind of tracking. But 9 of 10 sites shouldn&rsquo;t need this. You could
argue that most administrators use this tracking only for dopamine fix
and don&rsquo;t utilize the tracked data. Even though they might use it
somehow, how they inform the user? I dare to say that information about
data usage is almost always written in some shallow boilerplate text or
no way at all.</p>
<h2 id="informed-consent">Informed Consent</h2>
<p><a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> highlights mainly four things about data usage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It enables EU citizens to have the final say on how their data is used.
If your company any way handles PIIs, there are tighter restrictions
on how these can be handled.
Companies can store/use data only if the person consents to it.
User has rights to their data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consent is the crucial part here since I believe that many sites lack on
this front. There has been a lot of discussion about what should is
considered consent. <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/">GDPR Art. 6.1(f)</a>
says that &ldquo;processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
interests pursued by the controller or by a third party&rdquo;. Now legitimate
interest is relatively shallow and <a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/news/germany-dpas-issue-statements-consent-cookies-and-google-analytics%C2%A0">quite a few authorities in Germany,
for example, consider that third-party analytics do not fall under
&ldquo;legitimate
interest&rdquo;</a>. You
can utilize consent management platforms to ensure you have user&rsquo;s
consent before you drop the tracking code in your page. But this then
raises the question of what can be considered consent.</p>
<p>Drew DeVault wrote a great post about <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/12/04/Analytics-and-informed-consent.html">web analytics and informed
consent</a>. Informed
consent is a principle from healthcare, but it still can offer
significant elements to be utilized, especially in technology and
privacy. Drew split up the essential elements of informed consent in
tracking to these three points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disclosure of the nature and purpose of the research and its
implications (risks and benefits) for the participant, and the
confidentiality of the collected information.</li>
<li>An adequate understanding of these facts on the part of the
participant, requiring an accessible explanation in lay terms and an
assessment of understanding.</li>
<li>The participant must exercise voluntary agreement, without coercion or</li>
<li>fear of repercussions (e.g. not being allowed to use your website).</li>
</ol>
<p>Considering these essential elements of informed consent, we can agree
that most sites that do tracking don&rsquo;t follow these guidelines.</p>
<p>Thankfully trivial tracker blocking is supported already in many
browsers, which makes this issue slightly more bearable, and also,
you&rsquo;re able to download external tools to do it. But still, this kind of
approach is pretty upside down.</p>
<h2 id="all-kinds-of-cookies">All Kinds of Cookies</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, ad-tech companies have tried to make blocking these
harder and harder by constantly evolving these cookies to <a href="https://home.sophos.com/en-us/security-news/2019/supercookies.aspx">evercookies,
supercookies,
etc.</a>
The way these have worked is that trackers have stored these harder to
detect and delete cookies in different obscure places in the browser,
like Flash storage or HSTS flags. Evercookies were a big thing in early
2010 since many sites were using Flash and Silverlight, and those were
very exploitable. Today those technologies aren&rsquo;t used anymore, but that
doesn&rsquo;t mean the evolution of cookies has stopped. Supercookies, on the
other hand, work on the network level of your service provider.</p>
<p>Thankfully lately, for example, <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/01/26/supercookie-protections/">Firefox has been able to start tackling
these</a>. In
that post, the Firefox team discloses what they had to do to take some
actions against this, and it is wild. They had to re-architect the whole
connection handling in the browser, which was first made to increase
user experience by reducing overhead to eliminate these pesky
cache-based cookies.</p>
<p>Still, <a href="https://home.sophos.com/en-us/security-news/2019/supercookies.aspx">browser
fingerprinting</a>
could be considered the evilest cookie of them all. Browser
fingerprinting identifies everything it can from your system. Like some
cookies, this does have some real use cases, e.g., preventing fraud in
financial institutions. Still, mostly this is just another intrusive way
to track people. Thankfully some modern browsers offer at least some
ways to avoid this, but not a full-fledged solution (other than
disposable systems).</p>
<h2 id="future-of-cookies">Future of cookies</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.axios.com/google-privacy-friendly-substitute-cookies-test-05c2c28e-77f1-4921-9a99-1ef0c009b064.html">Lately, there has been some news about privacy-friendly substitutes to
cookies by tech
giants.</a>
Cookies have been a relatively significant issue privacy-wise for
decades, and since the ad industry is so large, finding a replacement
for these have been hard. So only time will tell. I believe that we
cannot get rid of cookies entirely in the near future. They might change
into something else, maybe this kind of API utilizing machine learning
analyzing user data. Which I don&rsquo;t know is better or worse. So cannot
wait! <em>tin-foil hat tightens</em></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So what is the conclusion here? Probably nothing. Recently started
small-time blogger just got scared from big numbers coming into his site
collecting all kinds of data which ended up him stopping this kind of
action at least in his site. Since for most users/sites, this kind of
tracking is just a silly monkey-get-banana dopamine fix.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t track unless you need to and if you do, inform it thoroughly.</p>
