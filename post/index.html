    <div id="post-summary">
      I&rsquo;ve lately started to ponder the repercussions of this trend of extravagant architectural choices in the tech industry. Mostly these kinds of options seem to be prevalent in this current era of cloud computing. At least, I seem to stumble upon these regularly when I work with a wide variety of different distributed systems as a DevOps/SRE consultant. Great examples in this kind of trend are various Kubernetes setups in projects where you could easily manage to progress without it or some data infrastructure solution that feels like a sledgehammer for hitting a small nail.

    <h4><a href="https://topikettunen.com/post/contemplating-web-analytics/">Contemplating Web Analytics</a></h4>
    
    <div id="post-summary">
      I started to rekindle my, unfortunately, lost writing habit a couple of weeks ago. I set up Google Analytics for this page mainly due to its ease of use to see simple analytics. I was only interested in visitor count and possibly from what source my readers are coming. Google Analytics is a massive tool with massive amounts of data going into it. I tried to restrict this collection as much as possible so it suits my personal blog&rsquo;s needs.

    <div id="post-summary">
      When talking about the tools of the trade, almost regardless of the industry, email seems to be a vital tool. The same applies to me. Obviously, in the tech industry, everything goes by email. But also in music. If I happen to record, mix or master something, pretty much always these are shared with email.
Email is also a crucial part of my workflow, so I care about my productivity while using it.

    <div id="post-summary">
      Docker has stormed into software development in recent years. While the concepts behind it are powerful and useful, similar tools have been used in systems for decades. FreeBSD&rsquo;s jails in one of those tools which build upon even older chroot(2) To put it shortly, with these tools, you can make a safe environment separated from the rest of the system.
Jails in FreeBSD is by no means a new tool (introduced in 4.

    <h4><a href="https://topikettunen.com/post/reawakening-long-lost-habit/">Reawakening Long Lost Habit (or Forming a New One)</a></h4>
    
    <div id="post-summary">
      A couple of years ago, I had a good habit of writing semi-regularly about various exciting topics. Unfortunately, time passed, and I began to write less and less, and recently I&rsquo;ve gotten out of the habit altogether. This is a shame in many ways since I&rsquo;ve always felt writing to be immensely therapeutic.
At the time of writing, this world is also in a very odd place. Most of the countries worldwide are quarantined due to COVID-19, and people are staying in their homes.
