      <title>Contemplating Web Analytics</title>
      <link>https://kettunen.io/post/contemplating-web-analytics/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Feb 2021 20:25:35 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://kettunen.io/post/contemplating-web-analytics/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started to rekindle my, unfortunately, lost writing habit a couple of
weeks ago. I set up Google Analytics for this page mainly due to its
ease of use to see simple analytics. I was only interested in visitor
count and possibly from what source my readers are coming. Google
Analytics is a massive tool with massive amounts of data going into
it. I tried to restrict this collection as much as possible so it suits
my personal blog&amp;rsquo;s needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then my page rose to the front page of Hacker News, and it started to
get a lot of traction. Suddenly there were thousands of readers coming
every day to my pesky little page with just a few posts as I was
following the visitor counts rising in my Google Analytics view. That
got me thinking about the ethics of this kind of tracking. Which then
ended up me deleting my account and data from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;discomfort-of-tracking&#34;&gt;Discomfort of Tracking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I deleted my data and account from Google Analytics, I first
looked for different alternatives. I stumbled upon many other
privacy-oriented and GDPR-compliant analytics platforms, which at first
seemed promising. Also, having good options for ever prevalent Google
Analytics is a great thing. But despite these features, they don&amp;rsquo;t
remove the uneasiness what mining your users&#39; data causes. We are
talking about spying here. Thankfully there are now some restrictions
regarding personally identifiable information (PII), at least in the
GDPR, limiting the shadiness of this quite a lot. But that brings new
issues in handling this kind of information since you need to be sure
that your software doesn&amp;rsquo;t leak this information. Thankfully also
opting-out completely from collecting PII in your software is an
option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand why people might want to add at least simplistic tracking
to their sites since it can provide useful information about your
content, and companies can see how users use their site, and the list
goes on. Especially when you combine Google Analytics, or similar
analytics tool, to ads, companies can reap significant benefits from
this kind of tracking. But 9 of 10 sites shouldn&amp;rsquo;t need this. You could
argue that most administrators use this tracking only for dopamine fix
and don&amp;rsquo;t utilize the tracked data. Even though they might use it
somehow, how they inform the user? I dare to say that information about
data usage is almost always written in some shallow boilerplate text or
no way at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;informed-consent&#34;&gt;Informed Consent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gdpr-info.eu/&#34;&gt;GDPR&lt;/a&gt; highlights mainly four things about data usage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It enables EU citizens to have the final say on how their data is used.
If your company any way handles PIIs, there are tighter restrictions
on how these can be handled.
Companies can store/use data only if the person consents to it.
User has rights to their data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consent is the crucial part here since I believe that many sites lack on
this front. There has been a lot of discussion about what should is
considered consent. &lt;a href=&#34;https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/&#34;&gt;GDPR Art. 6.1(f)&lt;/a&gt;
says that &amp;ldquo;processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
interests pursued by the controller or by a third party&amp;rdquo;. Now legitimate
interest is relatively shallow and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dataguidance.com/news/germany-dpas-issue-statements-consent-cookies-and-google-analytics%C2%A0&#34;&gt;quite a few authorities in Germany,
for example, consider that third-party analytics do not fall under
&amp;ldquo;legitimate
interest&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. You
can utilize consent management platforms to ensure you have user&amp;rsquo;s
consent before you drop the tracking code in your page. But this then
raises the question of what can be considered consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drew DeVault wrote a great post about &lt;a href=&#34;https://drewdevault.com/2020/12/04/Analytics-and-informed-consent.html&#34;&gt;web analytics and informed
consent&lt;/a&gt;. Informed
consent is a principle from healthcare, but it still can offer
significant elements to be utilized, especially in technology and
privacy. Drew split up the essential elements of informed consent in
tracking to these three points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disclosure of the nature and purpose of the research and its
implications (risks and benefits) for the participant, and the
confidentiality of the collected information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An adequate understanding of these facts on the part of the
participant, requiring an accessible explanation in lay terms and an
assessment of understanding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The participant must exercise voluntary agreement, without coercion or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fear of repercussions (e.g. not being allowed to use your website).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering these essential elements of informed consent, we can agree
that most sites that do tracking don&amp;rsquo;t follow these guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully trivial tracker blocking is supported already in many
browsers, which makes this issue slightly more bearable, and also,
you&amp;rsquo;re able to download external tools to do it. But still, this kind of
approach is pretty upside down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;all-kinds-of-cookies&#34;&gt;All Kinds of Cookies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, ad-tech companies have tried to make blocking these
harder and harder by constantly evolving these cookies to &lt;a href=&#34;https://home.sophos.com/en-us/security-news/2019/supercookies.aspx&#34;&gt;evercookies,
supercookies,
etc.&lt;/a&gt;
The way these have worked is that trackers have stored these harder to
detect and delete cookies in different obscure places in the browser,
like Flash storage or HSTS flags. Evercookies were a big thing in early
2010 since many sites were using Flash and Silverlight, and those were
very exploitable. Today those technologies aren&amp;rsquo;t used anymore, but that
doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean the evolution of cookies has stopped. Supercookies, on the
other hand, work on the network level of your service provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully lately, for example, &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/01/26/supercookie-protections/&#34;&gt;Firefox has been able to start tackling
these&lt;/a&gt;. In
that post, the Firefox team discloses what they had to do to take some
actions against this, and it is wild. They had to re-architect the whole
connection handling in the browser, which was first made to increase
user experience by reducing overhead to eliminate these pesky
cache-based cookies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, &lt;a href=&#34;https://home.sophos.com/en-us/security-news/2019/supercookies.aspx&#34;&gt;browser
fingerprinting&lt;/a&gt;
could be considered the evilest cookie of them all. Browser
fingerprinting identifies everything it can from your system. Like some
cookies, this does have some real use cases, e.g., preventing fraud in
financial institutions. Still, mostly this is just another intrusive way
to track people. Thankfully some modern browsers offer at least some
ways to avoid this, but not a full-fledged solution (other than
disposable systems).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;future-of-cookies&#34;&gt;Future of cookies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.axios.com/google-privacy-friendly-substitute-cookies-test-05c2c28e-77f1-4921-9a99-1ef0c009b064.html&#34;&gt;Lately, there has been some news about privacy-friendly substitutes to
cookies by tech
giants.&lt;/a&gt;
Cookies have been a relatively significant issue privacy-wise for
decades, and since the ad industry is so large, finding a replacement
for these have been hard. So only time will tell. I believe that we
cannot get rid of cookies entirely in the near future. They might change
into something else, maybe this kind of API utilizing machine learning
analyzing user data. Which I don&amp;rsquo;t know is better or worse. So cannot
wait! &lt;em&gt;tin-foil hat tightens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is the conclusion here? Probably nothing. Recently started
small-time blogger just got scared from big numbers coming into his site
collecting all kinds of data which ended up him stopping this kind of
action at least in his site. Since for most users/sites, this kind of
tracking is just a silly monkey-get-banana dopamine fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t track unless you need to and if you do, inform it thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Leap of Faith in Email Providers</title>
      <link>https://kettunen.io/post/leap-of-faith-in-email-providers/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 24 Jan 2021 13:35:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://kettunen.io/post/leap-of-faith-in-email-providers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When talking about the tools of the trade, almost regardless of the
industry, email seems to be a vital tool. The same applies to
me. Obviously, in the tech industry, everything goes by email. But also
in music. If I happen to record, mix or master something, pretty much
always these are shared with email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email is also a crucial part of my workflow, so I care about my
productivity while using it. Recently I started to look for options for
my two different GSuite accounts. One of those was used for my personal
domain, and another one was used for my music publishing company. A big
reason behind the migration was that I found GSuite to be a little bit
too much for my needs. I don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have anything against
Google&amp;rsquo;s product, albeit I agree they have a little bit too big of a
footprint on the internet, so I at least try to limit my contributions
to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;requirements-for-provider&#34;&gt;Requirements for Provider&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only have two requirements for my provider: IMAP/SMTP support and the
ability to use my domain(s). Given these requirements, there are
probably hundreds of providers that would fit these requirements. But
after a while of skimming through different providers, I ended up with
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fastmail.com/&#34;&gt;FastMail&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://protonmail.com/&#34;&gt;ProtonMail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fastmail&#34;&gt;FastMail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FastMail seemed like a good fit when I first looked into it. Easily
manageable domains and reasonable pricing. I quickly tested it with
their offered trial account and was overall pretty pleased with their
product. Concerns about this then rose when I learned that the company
is from Australia. Not that I hate Australia by any means, but their
hostile and subversive laws regarding encryption are pretty sketchy. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about-us/our-portfolios/national-security/lawful-access-telecommunications/data-encryption&#34;&gt;The
assistance and access
act&lt;/a&gt;
allows, under Australia&amp;rsquo;s legislation, police to force companies to
create a technical function that would give them access to encrypted
messages without the user&amp;rsquo;s knowledge, which made FastMail pretty much a
no-go for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;protonmail&#34;&gt;ProtonMail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After finding Australia&amp;rsquo;s laws against encryption, it seemed like a
natural choice. I had already heard of them before and their stand on
security. ProtonMail doesn&amp;rsquo;t support IMAP/SMTP access, at least in the
standard way, mainly because of encryption, which is why I didn&amp;rsquo;t want
to go that route when I first heard of them. Nowadays, they do offer a
kind of unorthodox solution for this via their ProtonMail Bridge. By my
understanding, this only handles the authentication to your mail and
provider localhost-only endpoints to IMAP4/SMTP. Then you can configure
your mail client of choice with these new endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting solution, and at least for me, it seems to work and doesn&amp;rsquo;t
hinder my workflow that much. Still, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy
with their product and decided to migrate my emails to there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;honorable-mention-migadu&#34;&gt;Honorable Mention: Migadu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.migadu.com/index.html&#34;&gt;Migadu&lt;/a&gt;
Migadu is on the smaller end of the spectrum when talking about email
providers, but overall they seemed to have great values. Why I didn&amp;rsquo;t go
that route (yet?) is that I read that they have had some outages in
their services in the past. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that your email has been
lost since the global mail system is pretty tolerant for that, but not
being able to login into your mail, which can be pretty annoying. What
made them not very suitable for me is their bandwidth-based pricing and
daily limits on mail. I do work a lot with email and send and receive a
lot of them, so they did offer pricing suitable for my needs, but it
just was a little bit too expensive at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dishonorable-mention-self-hosting&#34;&gt;Dishonorable Mention: Self-hosting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FastMail at first seemed like a good fit, but due to Australia&amp;rsquo;s
legislation, it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for me. ProtonMail overall seems like
a pretty exciting provider, at least on paper and overall in practice too.
Service seemed to suite me, so I&amp;rsquo;ll continue to use their service at
least for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creating Comfy FreeBSD Jails Using Standard Tools</title>
      <link>https://kettunen.io/post/standard-freebsd-jails/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Jan 2021 20:20:26 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://kettunen.io/post/standard-freebsd-jails/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.docker.com/&#34;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; has stormed into software development in
recent years. While the concepts behind it are powerful and useful, similar
tools have been used in systems for decades. FreeBSD&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/jails.html&#34;&gt;jails&lt;/a&gt; in one of those tools
which build upon even older &lt;code&gt;chroot(2)&lt;/code&gt; To put it shortly, with these tools, you
can make a safe environment separated from the rest of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jails in FreeBSD is by no means a new tool (introduced in 4.X), but for a reason
or another, I haven&amp;rsquo;t used them that often, which is a shame since they are so
powerful. So I wanted to explore this concept in a concise and summarized
manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;templates&#34;&gt;Templates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZFS datasets are a great way of creating templates for jails since, after the
template creation, you can easily create new jails with &lt;code&gt;zfs clone&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;zfs send/receive&lt;/code&gt;. Typically people tend to divide jails to complete and service
jails, where the former usually resembles a real FreeBSD system, and the latter
is often dedicated to applications/services. I&amp;rsquo;ll cover complete jails for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creation of templates starts with creating a dataset for your jail and
template. Here I&amp;rsquo;ll make a new dataset for the base installation of FreeBSD
12.2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo zfs create -o mountpoint=/vm zroot/vm
$ sudo zfs create zroot/vm/tmpl
$ sudo zfs create zroot/vm/tmpl/12.2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, fetch the base installation itself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ fetch ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/amd64/12.2-RELEASE/base.txz
# Fetch all the necessary stuff for your template, e.g. lib32 if needed
$ sudo tar -xJvpf base.txz -C /vm/tmpl/12.2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that you should write a minimum viable &lt;code&gt;/etc/rc.conf&lt;/code&gt; for the template:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo emacs /vm/tmpl/12.2/etc/rc.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Refer to &lt;code&gt;rc.conf(5)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Start or stop services
sendmail_enable=&amp;quot;NO&amp;quot;
sendmail_submit_enable=&amp;quot;NO&amp;quot;
sendmail_outbound_enable=&amp;quot;NO&amp;quot;
sendmail_msp_queue_enable=&amp;quot;NO&amp;quot;
syslogd_flags=&amp;quot;-ss&amp;quot;
cron_flags=&amp;quot;-J 60&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also disable some unnecessary jobs for jails:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo emacs /vm/tmpl/12.2/etc/periodic.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Refer to &lt;code&gt;periodic.conf(5)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

security_status_tcpwrap_enable=&amp;quot;NO&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;You also might want to enable ports in your jail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo mkdir /vm/tmpl/12.2/usr/ports
$ sudo mkdir -p /vm/tmpl/12.2/var/ports/{distfiles,packages}
$ sudo emacs /vm/tmpl/12.2/etc/make.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;WRKDIRPREFIX = /var/ports
DISTDIR = /var/ports/distfiles
PACKAGES = /var/ports/packages
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apply system updates to the template:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo freebsd-update -b /vm/tmpl/12.2 fetch install
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, take a snapshot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo zfs snapshot zroot/vm/tmpl/12.2@complete
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This creates a snapshot of &lt;code&gt;zroot/vm/tmpl/12.2&lt;/code&gt; named &lt;code&gt;complete&lt;/code&gt;. You can then check your current snapshots with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo zfs list -t snapshot
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;creating-jails-from-the-template&#34;&gt;Creating Jails from the Template&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you should be able to create a new jail based on that snapshot. You can do
it either with &lt;code&gt;zfs clone&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;zfs send/receive&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difference Between the Two&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A clone is a writable volume or file system whose initial contents are the
same as the dataset from which it was created. As with snapshots, creating a
clone is nearly instantaneous and initially consumes no additional disk
space. In addition, you can snapshot a clone.&amp;rdquo; [1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The zfs send command creates a stream representation of a snapshot that is
written to standard output. By default, a full stream is generated. You can
redirect the output to a file or to a different system. The zfs receive
command creates a snapshot whose contents are specified in the stream that is
provided on standard input. If a full stream is received, a new file system is
created as well. You can send ZFS snapshot data and receive ZFS snapshot data
and file systems with these commands. See the examples in the next section.&amp;rdquo;
[2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo zfs clone zroot/vm/tmpl/12.2@complete zroot/vm/jail1

# OR

$ sudo sh -c &amp;quot;zfs send zroot/vm/tmpl/12.2@complete | zfs receive zroot/vm/jail1&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;jail-configurations&#34;&gt;Jail Configurations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: These configurations is for very bare-bones jail, e.g. without any
mounts or advanced networking. Further configurations are discussed in future posts.&lt;/p&gt;

networking and configurations. But I think those deserve their own posts. So see

      <title>Reawakening Long Lost Habit (or Forming a New One)</title>
      <link>https://kettunen.io/post/reawakening-long-lost-habit/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, I had a good habit of writing semi-regularly about
various exciting topics. Unfortunately, time passed, and I began to write less
and less, and recently I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten out of the habit altogether. This is a shame
in many ways since I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt writing to be immensely therapeutic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, this world is also in a very odd place. Most of the
countries worldwide are quarantined due to COVID-19, and people are staying in
their homes. Yours truly included! So as a way to pass the the time during these
times, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to reawaken this habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habitual writing has been on my mind for a long time, especially since it has
been so present in my life before. I&amp;rsquo;ve also somehow lost a few other healthy
habits, which lately have made me think about how I can reawaken them in my
day-to-day life. Healthy practices that come to mind that I&amp;rsquo;ve lost would
definitely be workouts and meditation. Although you could argue that the lost
habit of working out is mainly related to the current difficult times, I&amp;rsquo;m not
too worried. That I believe that eventually, when the world calms down in terms
of this pandemic, I can relearn that habit quite quickly. But losing the regular
practice of meditation is really a shame, in my opinion. Similar to working out,
meditation has been playing a big part in my life for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though my meditation practices have been irregular lately, the earlier
&amp;ldquo;hard work&amp;rdquo; has definitely helped me in my everyday life. But recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve
started thinking about how I could relearn this habit. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned that at
least in my own case best way to learn habit has definitely been doing something
often but not in an excessive amount. So in meditation, this was easy. Start by
5 or 10 minutes (which is nothing, and everyone can find time for this) and just
do it the same time and place every day. Current times supported in relearning
this since people are mostly working remotely, so it is easy to start your day
with this practice. With these simple steps, I feel like that I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to
reawaken this practice that was once very present in my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This got me thinking about utilizing a similar approach in some other practices
that I&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten. The practices that came to mind were music and
writing. Although some could argue that these are more or less the same
thing. For some reason, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a real hard time picking up my instruments and
writing some new music during the pandemic. I believe that many others have the
same feelings in their own area of interest. I don&amp;rsquo;t know the cause for this;
maybe the constant staring at the same four walls for over a year is the
culprit. Who knows? A similar thing has also happened in my writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really got me wanting to reawaken these habits was when I stumbled upon
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dreamsongs.com/Bio.html&#34;&gt;Richard P. Gabriel&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; poetry. Gabriel is a
legendary Lisp programmer. As a Lisp programmer myself, I&amp;rsquo;m always interested in
what other like-minded people are up to. Gabriel started a project of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dreamsongs.com/DailyPoems.html&#34;&gt;writing
one poem a day on March 18, 2000&lt;/a&gt; to
end a lengthy poetry-writing slump. Gabriel agrees that he is not necessarily a
great poet, even though many could argue that, but I think that is
non-essential. While forming this kind of habit, you don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily need to
be the new Robert Frost. But since writing poetry (or anything) is a technical
skill, constant practice is bound to help you in your journey. I stumbled upon a
similar approach while reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Better-Lyrics-Pat-Pattison/dp/1582975779&#34;&gt;Pat Pattison&amp;rsquo;s Writing Better
Lyrics&lt;/a&gt;,
where he talked about &amp;ldquo;daily object writing&amp;rdquo; in terms of getting better at
writing. Pattison also noted that forming a habit is the big thing in this,
which will eventually result in getting better at writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach is more or less similar to how I learned the healthy habit of
regular meditation. How could I apply a similar approach to my composing and
writing? Knowing myself, I cannot do this kind of creative work sporadically (or
waiting for the creative slump to end), or I&amp;rsquo;ll never do it. If I tried to write
one piece and post every day, I feel that doing both daily would be a little bit
excessive (mainly timewise). So I need to find a healthy balance in practice and
not making it over-encumbered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I believe that some time-boxed, very focused practice on something
works the best. So what I&amp;rsquo;m intending to do is that I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on a period (half
an hour, an hour or so) on the given task, whether it is composing, writing, or
programming (another healthy habit that I practice which thankfully haven&amp;rsquo;t been
lost, but I always feel I could do more of it). I&amp;rsquo;ll set a healthy goal for this
time-box, so I don&amp;rsquo;t expect to write some new groundbreaking sonata, some
earth-shattering blog post, or the next big open source project. I&amp;rsquo;ll just want
to do something in these fields regularly to hone my skills in the given area. I
also understand that since I&amp;rsquo;m trying to work on multiple habits, I might not
always have time to do everything. That&amp;rsquo;s okay. I can most likely squeeze in a
smaller session so that you have at least some practice. Or if I just simply
cannot do anything, that&amp;rsquo;s fine too. I just don&amp;rsquo;t want to see myself doing
something excessively one day and then slacking off the next day since &amp;ldquo;I did so
much yesterday&amp;rdquo; (learned from Pattison).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Productivity overall has been really close to my heart, even though I
occasionally lack significantly in that area. But maybe with small steps,
everyone can benefit somehow in a slight boost of their own productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or just procrastinate&amp;hellip; As long as you&amp;rsquo;re happy.&lt;/p&gt;
