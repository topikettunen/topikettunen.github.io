    <div id="post-summary">
      I have a spine of a toddler when it comes to losing countless hours to distractions. While I wouldn&rsquo;t say that I have focus issues, I have noticed that I can easily spend hours on non-essential sites that don&rsquo;t bring anything to my life. Social media has been one of them. I have always had a pretty weird relationship with social media. A long time ago, I joined Facebook and Instagram because many of my friends and family were already there.

    <div id="post-summary">
      I have always enjoyed reading about other peoples productivity hacks and their workflows, in general, when it comes to whatever they might be doing. I often stumble upon reading on how people manage to maintain an extravagant lifestyle with dozens of different hobbies, interests, and passions with ease. So it makes me wonder how they manage their time to maintain a healthy level of participation in their interests without burning out.

    <h4><a href="https://topikettunen.com/posts/arts-and-future/">AI, Arts and the Future</a></h4>
    
    <div id="post-summary">
      Since the discussion about artificial intelligence has become mainstream, I have started to ponder the possible impacts AI might have on our day-to-day lives. While I work in tech, I come from this &ldquo;culture and arts&rdquo; background at least a little bit. I did some theatre when I was young and also have worked with music in one way or another for most of my life. This kind of background has got me thinking about how AI could affect these fields.
