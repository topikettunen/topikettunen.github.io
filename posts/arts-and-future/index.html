      <p>Since the discussion about artificial intelligence has become
mainstream, I have started to ponder the possible impacts AI might have
on our day-to-day lives. While I work in tech, I come from this &ldquo;culture
and arts&rdquo; background at least a little bit. I did some theatre when I
was young and also have worked with music in one way or another for most
of my life. This kind of background has got me thinking about how AI
could affect these fields.</p>
<p>We have already seen multiple interdisciplinary works mixing artificial
intelligence with various art forms, like drawings, paintings, music
etc. Already drawings and paintings generated with AI present a superb
quality in those, in which you cannot make a clear distinction from if
these were created by AI or a real human. On the other hand, music is
not quite at that level yet, at least in my opinion. At least in the
form of an entirely generated song by AI. That being said, I have heard
great pieces which utilize both human touch and AI, where AI plays more
of a supportive role in the whole work. Similar things can be seen in
all the forms of creative endeavours where AI could be utilized.</p>
<p>If AI gets used more and more in these creative projects with great
success, to me, it raises a question, can human art be entirely replaced
with AI? I believe it would be naive to say that it couldn&rsquo;t. Especially
thinking about the possible future where we cannot distinguish humans
from computers, how we could distinct this kind of smaller medium like
song or book on how it was created or who created it? As a consumer of
these kinds of mediums, does it matter if some algorithms made your new
favourite novel if it can provide the same feeling that you might get
from reading a regular author&rsquo;s book?</p>
<h2 id="they-are-taking-our-jobs">They Are Taking Our Jobs</h2>
<p>To put it shortly, AI can replace anyone&rsquo;s job who happens to handle
bits in one way or another. This means that in these kinds of jobs, AI
can do it way better than you ever can. When we talk about &ldquo;creative
jobs&rdquo;, how you can do it better than someone else? Are you possibly
better at drawing than someone else? Or can you compose better
symphonies than someone else? What makes you better? Is it purely a
technical thing, or is there something else? When we talk about painting
or drawing&rsquo;s technicality, sure, you could argue that your &ldquo;pen
strokes&rdquo;, etc. might be better than someone else&rsquo;s. But does this make
it better art?</p>
<p>Already there has been a trend of AI-generated music populating
different streaming platforms. Currently, that music has almost always
been something simple, in which AI definitely can excel. This could be
called elevator music or Muzak. This kind of music is most likely
something that many people wouldn&rsquo;t mind that it&rsquo;s generated with
computer and lacks the human touch. But how people would feel if there
would be a chart-topping song that was entirely generated with AI? I
believe many people wouldn&rsquo;t like that, other than a few tech geeks who
might think it could be cool (me included).</p>
<p>Could then AI fully replace the human touch in our art forms? We might
wait for that to happen for a very long time. Still, as I said earlier,
it would be naive to think that this couldn&rsquo;t happen, especially in the
future, where we have reached a certain level of intelligence where we
can&rsquo;t distinguish each other from humans and machines.</p>
<p>So what could this mean for our &ldquo;blue-collar&rdquo; artists? What could be the
driving force for them to create new art if the possible audience
doesn&rsquo;t know if it was created by computer or human? To me, that seems
very grim.</p>
<h2 id="creative-programming">Creative Programming</h2>
<p>If we can&rsquo;t beat them, join &lsquo;em? Right? If we think that this will be
the future, while it might not be a very uplifting thing to consider,
it&rsquo;ll most likely be very realistic. While I think that AI will have
some bad repercussions on our life in the future, I also believe that it
can be used for great good. Whether AI is used in health, fighting
climate change etc., there are many good use cases. In my opinion,
utilizing AI in the arts is also one of them. Should you create your
next song or novel entirely with AI? Possibly no, although GPT-3 has
shown some great results on how good text it can write.</p>
<p>I personally at least like to write or play music, so I don&rsquo;t want to
replace the process that I enjoy so much with something artificial. So
the way I could utilize it in my creative endeavours is by working with
it side by side. Possibly, it could generate some ideas for me for my
next blog post, novel, poem or whatever. AI could be taught with the
text of a long list of your favourite authors or songs by your favourite
bands. Based on this knowledge, maybe some of the possible ideas it
could generate could then be finished by a human giving the final piece
that human touch.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>So while the future might look dark and grim for us, maybe we could make
some use of it, so at least we might have a little bit of
enjoyment. Thankfully we are a long way from this singularity that many
people tend to talk about, but the trend has shown to be moving towards
that kind of future. So rather than fighting against it, at least
personally, I want to make the best use of our technical achievements in
one way or another. Who knows if the next big novel or piece is created
along with AI or some other great technological invention. That being
said, I have already found many great ways to utilize AI in my creative
projects, so who knows what might come out of those.</p>
