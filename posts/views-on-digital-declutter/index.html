      <p>I have a spine of a toddler when it comes to losing countless hours to
distractions. While I wouldn&rsquo;t say that I have focus issues, I have
noticed that I can easily spend hours on non-essential sites that don&rsquo;t
bring anything to my life. Social media has been one of them. I have
always had a pretty weird relationship with social media. A long time
ago, I joined Facebook and Instagram because many of my friends and
family were already there. While I never did post stuff actively, I
always noticed that I just ended up mindlessly surfing these, especially
on Instagram.</p>
<p>A couple of years back, I became conscious about this and decided to
delete my accounts on these platforms without giving too much thought
about it. While leaving these platforms were pretty easy for me, I
noticed that I had just replaced these with some other platform, YouTube
in my case. After which, I started spending countless hours on that
platform instead. For some reason, back then, I didn&rsquo;t consider this
habit being as bad as mindlessly browsing Instagram or Facebook despite
it being the same thing. I think I just rationalized it to myself being
educational or informative in a better way than other platforms.</p>
<p>Year or two passes without Instagram or Facebook completely fine, but
then for some reason, I wanted to start using them again. Maybe I
thought to myself that I had already been cured of this disease so I
could have a healthy relationship with them from now on. I also had
professional reasons behind this since I thought that these platforms
offer a great way of marketing your art to others, which is true in some
cases. Very quickly, I started noticing similar behaviour that occurred
when I last was on these platforms. So after a couple of months of
trying to get back in, I just felt repulsed by them and decided to leave
them again. When it comes to marketing, that is just not for me. I
understand the benefits of being an artist in social media. Still, since
I mainly enjoy that as a passionate hobby, I don&rsquo;t see the need for
being on social media.</p>
<p>So at the time of writing this, I think it has been about six months or
so of living without these. Still, I&rsquo;m very conscious about my
unnecessarily large usage of apps like YouTube, News etc. While
comparing my use with Instagram, I still wouldn&rsquo;t consider watching
YouTube or regularly checking news as bad as mindlessly scrolling
through your feeds. I still noticed similar behaviour on those that I
was struggling with, for example, with Instagram. I became conscious
about randomly picking up my phone and scrolling through news even
though I had just read them or just letting YouTube&rsquo;s autoplay roll for
long periods without giving too much thought about it. So I wanted to
tackle these habits.</p>
<p>I have noticed that the most extreme methods work the best when trying
to fix some bad habit, at least in my case. So I didn&rsquo;t want to ease
when trying to have a healthy relationship with these applications but
instead go cold turkey immediately. <a href="https://github.com/topikettunen/sitebegone">Also, to help me in this, I wrote a
simple application that allows blocking distracting sites
&ldquo;completely&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>So how has this worked for me? I think great! In the beginning, I
noticed how much free time I have when I don&rsquo;t spend it on useless
things. Also, in the beginning, I occasionally picked up my phone by
instinct. I quickly realized that I don&rsquo;t have any applications where I
could spend mindlessly surfing, so I quickly grew out of this
habit. First, I felt slight boredom when I couldn&rsquo;t spend time on these
apps, but thankfully I realized that this spare time needs to be used
elsewhere. Before this, I was already reading relatively a lot, about
three to four books per month, but I have almost doubled that number
nowadays. I also wrote about <a href="https://topikettunen.com/posts/time-management-with-multiple-passions/">time management between multiple
passions</a>
a while ago where I pondered how I manage time between, for example,
programming and music. After ditching distractive sites entirely, I have
felt that the time management between these activities and my work life
hasn&rsquo;t been an issue. It&rsquo;s straightforward to find time for various pet
projects and serious work outside my work life since I don&rsquo;t spend my
time on useless stuff anymore.</p>
<p>Do I see myself using these applications in the future? Well, I want to
read the news and do continue to do so, but not just constantly. I
usually catch up with recent events in the morning, but I don&rsquo;t desire
to install any news apps on my telephone. When it comes to these
streaming platforms, YouTube, Netflix, etc., I could live without
them. There are lots of good information on these platforms, so if I
need to watch some video, I can allow myself to do so. I don&rsquo;t want them
to control my life in a way that I&rsquo;m not comfortable with.</p>
