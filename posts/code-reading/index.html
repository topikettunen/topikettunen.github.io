      <p>Code reading has always been this activity that I&rsquo;ve just done without
really giving any thought to it. But despite this, now, when I look back
at this habit, I see it is immensely beneficial. This habit caught my
attention when I was reading Peter Seibel&rsquo;s book Coders at Work, in
which there is a section where Peter asks about code reading from his
interviewees. It tended to be unanimous amongst his interviewees that
code reading is very beneficial. Still, while reading his interviews, it
left a picture that even within those heavyweight programmers, the
practice itself seemed to be lacking. Exception in this being Brad
Fitzpatrick and, obviously, Donald Knuth. If these kinds of programmers
speak for this practice but don&rsquo;t do it in the wild, then who does? This
overall, it seems pretty odd to me. Seibel made a great comparison
regarding this when he compared programmers to novelists, where if
novelist hasn&rsquo;t read anyone else&rsquo;s publications, it would be unheard
of.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed reading others' source code mainly, let&rsquo;s face it,
to steal some ideas. But doing this, I&rsquo;ve able to receive a long list of
different lessons, ideas, and patterns, which I&rsquo;ve been able to utilize
frequently in most of the work that I&rsquo;ve done after these revelations.</p>
<h2 id="pattern-matching">Pattern Matching</h2>
<p>One of the most significant benefits that I&rsquo;ve learned while code
reading is that you&rsquo;re able to learn various patterns after a
while. Sure, every project might seem cluttered and hard to understand
for a while, but when you get the gist of it, you start to realize why
this or that has been done the way it is. When you&rsquo;ve understood some of
these patterns, it gets much more comfortable to start noticing them in
other similar or not so similar projects. Fundamentally this means the
graph of WTF-per-seconds starts getting less and less.</p>
<p>I have also noticed that this kind of pattern matching helps understand
the whole project under study itself. It would be best if you didn&rsquo;t try
to comprehend a large open-source project at once but in small
pieces. When one of these pieces is understood, it can help tremendously
in understanding the other pieces.</p>
<h2 id="benefits-of-reinventing">Benefits of reinventing</h2>
<p>Now, quite often, it can be pretty hard to understand the functionality
of some part of a big program just by looking at the code. So quite
often, to get a better grasp of foreign code is to reimplement the way
you would write it. This way, you&rsquo;re able to abstract the bread and
butter out of the program and utilize it however you might want.</p>
<p>This kind of reimplementing can be quite hard on bigger projects. The
best way to reinvent something in those projects is to change something
and see changes in the new compilation. For example, try to change some
text in some menu or output. This way, you can easily test how well you
understand the foreign code.</p>
<h2 id="code-as-a-literature-medium">Code as a literature medium</h2>
<p>Many people tend to say that code is not literature because you read it
differently than prose. In my opinion, this doesn&rsquo;t necessarily need to
be the case. Overall, code is written for humans first and then machine
second. An excellent example of this is Robert C. Martin&rsquo;s ravings, in
which he often recites that the &ldquo;code should read like prose to be
clean&rdquo;, which I tend to agree with. Another good one is Donald Knuth&rsquo;s
approach with literate programming. However, the latter one is more
about embedding code pieces amidst what one could call
prose. Nonetheless, this kind of system makes the code much more
readable since the writing itself is such a big part.</p>
<p>One thing that I believe makes people think code is not literature is
syntax highlighting. I don&rsquo;t use it. For some reason, I never grow used
to colored text. Of course, I might be a little bit biased, but when I
turn on syntax highlighting, I tend to focus on the wrong things in the
code, making it so that it doesn&rsquo;t read like prose anymore. Removing
syntax highlighting has allowed me to get a better grasp of the whole
structure more easily. Is this true, or does it work for everyone? I
don&rsquo;t think so, but that&rsquo;s how I feel.</p>
<h2 id="code-reading-club">Code Reading Club</h2>
<p>Based on these thoughts and Seibel&rsquo;s ideas, I decided to give some sort
of code reading club a try in my workplace. Initially, what I had in
mind for this kind of club was choosing one library/program per
week/month or whatever and then dissect the main logic behind it and
discuss it. I quickly realized that this would most likely work since
people have different interests in programming. For example, I don&rsquo;t
have an interest in various GUI applications or other frontend
technologies, even though they might have some good ideas behind them.</p>
<p>So a much better approach would most likely be that person chooses one
library/program and then dissects it sharing the findings to the rest of
the group. This dissection done by someone else than yourself could
easily inspire you and others to dive more deeply into the code itself,
even though it might be a little bit outside your interests. That being
said, exploring the world around your circles can be mind-opening since
you can easily find new approaches to the same problems that you might
face in your work.</p>
<p>I want to give this kind of approach a good try, and I could write some
&ldquo;deep thoughts&rdquo; about it in the form of a review.</p>
