      <p>I&rsquo;ve lately started to ponder the repercussions of this trend of
extravagant architectural choices in the tech industry. Mostly these
kinds of options seem to be prevalent in this current era of cloud
computing. At least, I seem to stumble upon these regularly when I work
with a wide variety of different distributed systems as a DevOps/SRE
consultant. Great examples in this kind of trend are various Kubernetes
setups in projects where you could easily manage to progress without it
or some data infrastructure solution that feels like a sledgehammer for
hitting a small nail.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not bashing these technologies since I enjoy working with them, and
I work with them daily. They have their purpose, but quite often, this
purpose is meant for a way larger picture in mind. Now, if we focus on
the example of Kubernetes, sure, it can bring a lot of benefits, like
easier deployments, reducing complexity on large projects, and quite
often reducing costs. But no one can argue that it can be overkill in
many different projects. If it&rsquo;s not needed, it mainly brings
unnecessary complexity and reduces productivity in these projects. So it
can be a double-edged sword. But I don&rsquo;t want to focus on these singular
technologies in this topic since they feel minor on the grand scale.</p>
<h2 id="implications-on-our-evolution">Implications on our evolution</h2>
<p>When we are moving more and more to this science-fiction picture of the
future, we need to start thinking more about topics such as
transhumanism and how we are going to live with machines that&rsquo;ll
outsmart us. Understandably, topics associated with transhumanism, like
singularity, AI, nanotechnologies, cybernetics, and much more, are
challenging to discuss first of all on a technological level and but
also on a moral and ethical level. It is also hard to say that will we
even ever see the rise of these kinds of technologies. It could be that
our civilization can see that these inventions are possible, but we
cannot implement these. It could also be that technological evolution
has also started to get so rapid that we will see the big turn of events
in these topics in the near future. Overall <a href="https://www.kurzweilai.net/the-law-of-accelerating-returns">technological evolution grows exponentially</a>,
so the time between significant inventions gets shorter and shorter.
So, for now, we can only speculate on how things might turn out.</p>
<p>Whatever the outcome may be, I believe that some degree of optimism is
in place. I think the singularity is inevitable, and most of the
industry&rsquo;s actions indicate that the path is not towards good. These
actions are the main reason why these over-the-top architectural choices
might be hinting about something that might be inevitably bad.</p>
<p>When I talk about some projects using these &ldquo;sledgehammer&rdquo; solutions in
projects where they aren&rsquo;t necessary, I&rsquo;m overall talking about a small
pesky thing. What worries me about this topic is that we are using these
kinds of hyped-up tools, which happens to be the month&rsquo;s flavor in every
project; what could this mean, for example, in the development of AI or
other future technologies? Could the fact that we seem to have endless
resources cause something that cannot be reverted? <a href="https://www.wired.com/2000/04/joy-2/">Bill Joy wrote a
great essay about the future not needing us</a>,
which makes it scary to think that we run these extravagant systems just
mainly because we can. A similar thing applies to data collection and
many other issues in privacy. Most of the big platforms that utilize
some tracking tends to collect a lot of data, which quite often isn&rsquo;t
used thoroughly, so the data is collected to build minimal information
about the user. Possibly the rest are saved for later.</p>
<h2 id="smart-usage-of-limited-resources">Smart usage of limited resources</h2>
<p>Back in the olden days, when I wasn&rsquo;t even born, computers tended to be
understandably very limited in terms of resources. Computing has evolved
tremendously since allowing us to use these kinds of larger-than-life
solutions in environments where they wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be
needed. Now, has the quality of systems or programs evolved directly
proportional to the increase of computing power? Definitely not. The
fact that these kinds of powers are available to us everywhere has
possibly increased the number of innovations since more people can start
thinking possible uses for these machines that are all around us and
because they are in contact with them regularly. Although you could
think that since more people are in contact with these kinds of machines
daily that it would equal to more interest in programming etc. as
general. This doesn&rsquo;t seem to be the case.</p>
<p>Where I&rsquo;m getting with this is the fact that the quality tends to be
going down when we go towards the future; how could this be tackled?
Clearly, this kind of wild west design in these kinds of crucial systems
can&rsquo;t continue.</p>
<h2 id="strategic-approach-in-the-development">Strategic approach in the development</h2>
<p>When we are talking about this extravagancy phenomenon in tech projects,
it tends to affect the program/system developers the most. Often, they
are not making these decisions since, most of the time, it tends to be
someone from the ivory tower that plans these decisions. Thankfully,
these kinds of people tend to have at least some background in these
systems relatively frequently but not always. So should developer&rsquo;s
opinions matter more when thinking of various options for your project?
I believe Sun Microsystems had a great idea when they started to market
Java for people. Sun was a hardware company that figured out that to
sell more hardware, they had to please programmers first, which resulted
in Java being one of the most widely used languages today. Now, did Java
please programmers, maybe back then when people hated C++, but opinions
seem to have shifted in recent years,  although both languages still
enjoy immense support.</p>
<p>Overall, I think these large systems have their places in many domains,
but these domains where their power could use efficiently are very
rare. This ends up in a situation where we either have a lot of
unnecessary computing power just laying there or used for something
unnecessary. Now systems have this unnecessary complexity that mainly
hinders the workflow of the people developing the whole system.</p>
<p>I also think that doing something for the reason of &ldquo;this might be
needed in the future&rdquo; is a bad practice since this tends to end up in an
infinite loop of unnecessary work. Since more straightforward solutions
tend to be quite often good enough for most of the projects with much
better developer experience and much better efficiency. These kinds of
solutions also quite often allow effortless migration to a bigger and
better solution if it&rsquo;s needed. Don&rsquo;t optimize if it&rsquo;s not necessary.</p>
