      <p>I have always enjoyed reading about other peoples productivity hacks and
their workflows, in general, when it comes to whatever they might be
doing. I often stumble upon reading on how people manage to maintain an
extravagant lifestyle with dozens of different hobbies, interests, and
passions with ease. So it makes me wonder how they manage their time to
maintain a healthy level of participation in their interests without
burning out.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have dozens of different passions or interests in my life, but
my passions tend to be quite large on their own, so when combining those
with 40 hour work week, I need to think about my time management
thoroughly. These passions I would consider to be writing, music and
programming.  Fortunately, I currently work in the tech industry, so I
can get a good living by doing one of my passions. Writing on its own
isn&rsquo;t necessarily a huge topic/interest, as it only consumes times, but
the practice itself is pretty straight forward. On the other hand, music
is time-consuming, and it involves many different activities in my
case. Sure, you could argue that writing does include other practices,
too, like planning what to write, but music is on another level for
me. I play multiple different instruments, which I record for myself and
others in my home studio. I enjoy composing tunes, add some mixing and
mastering to this, and you need to sacrifice a lot of time for
this. Programming is also something that I enjoy spending my time
on. While I do it for a living, what makes me truly like it are the
projects I work on in my free time, whether it&rsquo;s my pet projects of
various sizes or some open-source projects.</p>
<p>Finding the time and focusing on the task at hand isn&rsquo;t necessarily an
issue on its own for me, but its more about maintaining a healthy
balance between all these passions that I hold dear to me. Although that
being said, I would consider being a very gifted procrastinator, so
focusing on the task at hand can often be difficult for me. Once I&rsquo;ve
gotten into the flow, focusing becomes no more an issue. A more
significant issue here is quite often finishing projects rather than
starting a new one (which I feel is entirely another issue to be
improved on).</p>
<p>When I work on my passions, I tend to focus for days or weeks on one
passion, e.g. programming, neglecting my other passions like writing and
music. This on its own isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing since I don&rsquo;t feel
that I&rsquo;m wasting my time when I&rsquo;m doing something that I enjoy and
something where I&rsquo;m able to get rewarded in multiple different ways. But
I would like to maintain an equal balance between my passions.</p>
<h2 id="tools-to-the-rescue">Tools to the rescue</h2>
<p>A while ago, I started reading about how other people have managed their
time with multiple different passions/hobbies, and almost unanimously,
everybody used various type of schedule for this. I have already used a
&ldquo;life management&rdquo; system for a long time to handle all my todo lists and
schedules related to my home and work life (insert praising words about
Emacs' org-mode here).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going into details about how I manage my life with org-mode,
but if you&rsquo;re interested in the tool, I would recommend going through
articles found at <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-gtd-etc.html">Org for GTD and other Task management
systems</a> and from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQS06Qjnkcc&amp;list=PLVtKhBrRV_ZkPnBtt_TD1Cs9PJlU0IIdE">Rainer
KÃ¶nig&rsquo;s OrgMode
tutorial</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One thing I realize that has been missing for a long time in my current
setup is the fact that I haven&rsquo;t scheduled when to work on what
project. While I&rsquo;ve split my free-time projects into sub-tasks and
occasionally schedule and deadline when to work/finish those, the work
has always been very sporadic on this front. The result has often been
so that I work for an X period on one project then move on to another,
so I often just forget what I was supposed to do on the earlier
project. For me, this often leads to unnecessary postponing of tasks or
cancelling/removing them completely. I also quickly start saying that
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it tomorrow&rdquo;, which everyone knows won&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<h2 id="starting-light">Starting light</h2>
<p>So how I started to approach the whole concept of time management
between multiple different interests was to make dedicated timeslots and
days for whatever I might be working on. I maintain numerous on-going
projects which don&rsquo;t necessarily have deadlines in them but are just
larger projects that I want to work on from time to time. Then these
projects have sub-projects which are usually scheduled with
deadlines. These projects and sub-projects might include something
related to work, home, open-source work, recording or simply just
writing something.</p>
<p>The way I nowadays approach working these is by dedicating timeslots for
something on a specific day. My work life and day-to-day home stuff take
a good portion from my days, but the rest of the time, I try to use it
as efficiently as possible. So on Monday, I might work on some
programming related endeavours based on my backlog, Tuesday something
else and so on. The way I still approach tasks haven&rsquo;t been changed in
any way, as in I still manage my tasks and TODOs and keep track of them,
but nowadays, I just dedicate specific days for specific
interest/passion.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This way, I don&rsquo;t feel that I&rsquo;m neglecting the stuff I want to work
on. Issues with this kind of approach are the context switching on
almost a daily basis. However, this kind of switching isn&rsquo;t necessarily
a bad thing. Personally, at least I don&rsquo;t want to think about
work-related topics after I&rsquo;ve &ldquo;clocked in the hours&rdquo;, but I want to do
something either to relax or to move my thoughts elsewhere. Issues that
I&rsquo;ve mainly stumbled with are that when on one day you might focus on
programming, and the next day you focus on music. While this switch on
its own hasn&rsquo;t been too bad in my case, but when I get back to, for
example, programming after doing something else for several days, it
always takes a while to get back to the flow. But I do believe that this
is just missing practice in the world of managing multiple different
passions.</p>
<p>I have now split my time between multiple passions for several weeks,
and I feel that this is an excellent way to go. It has also already
taught me about the stuff that I genuinely want to work with, since when
you write down what you want to do and when it&rsquo;s easy to spot the stuff
that you don&rsquo;t want to work on or just don&rsquo;t have an interest about
it. So this also works in my case to find the topics that genuinely
interest me. Will I continue to manage my time like this for long? Well
hopefully. I feel that this way, I can contribute to all the stuff that
makes my life interesting, so obviously, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to miss that.</p>
