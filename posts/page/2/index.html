    <div id="post-summary">
      When talking about the tools of the trade, almost regardless of the industry, email seems to be a vital tool. The same applies to me. Obviously, in the tech industry, everything goes by email. But also in music. If I happen to record, mix or master something, pretty much always these are shared with email.
Email is also a crucial part of my workflow, so I care about my productivity while using it.

    <div id="post-summary">
      A couple of years ago, I had a good habit of writing semi-regularly about various exciting topics. Unfortunately, time passed, and I began to write less and less, and recently I&rsquo;ve gotten out of the habit altogether. This is a shame in many ways since I&rsquo;ve always felt writing to be immensely therapeutic.
At the time of writing, this world is also in a very odd place. Most of the countries worldwide are quarantined due to COVID-19, and people are staying in their homes.
