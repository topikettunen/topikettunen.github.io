<p>I&rsquo;m a DevOps consultant at <a href="https://polarsquad.com">Polar Squad</a> and
a software engineer. I&rsquo;ve been working on topics such as operating
systems, distributed systems, networking, and virtualization. In the
wild, I mostly enjoy working with a wide variety of different developer
tools &ndash; compilers, profilers, debuggers &ndash; or digital signal processing
in the form of audio plug-ins.</p>
<p>Alongside that, whenever I have time, I try to thrive in different
creative endeavors like writing and music. Currently writing mainly my
incoherent rambles down to somewhere (see this blog) and music in almost
all of its forms, all the way from composing, playing, sound design to
mixing and mastering.</p>
<p>I approach programming in a similar manner to how a composer might
approach a new piece, a poet a new poet, or a painter a new painting
since there can be so much beauty and art hidden in this bastard child
of logic, individuality, and creativity that we call programming.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this, I don&rsquo;t have a set schedule for my posts,
although I&rsquo;m working on it. I would want to post at least weekly but
preferably more. I had a good writing habit couple of years ago, but for
some reason or another, I lost it, so now I&rsquo;m relearning this practice.</p>
<p>Questions, comments, ideas are always welcome! The best way to get a
hold of me is via the following links:</p>
