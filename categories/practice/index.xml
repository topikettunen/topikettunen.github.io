      <description>A couple of years ago, I had a good habit of writing semi-regularly about various exciting topics. Unfortunately, time passed, and I began to write less and less, and recently I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten out of the habit altogether. This is a shame in many ways since I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt writing to be immensely therapeutic.
At the time of writing, this world is also in a very odd place. Most of the countries worldwide are quarantined due to COVID-19, and people are staying in their homes.</description>
